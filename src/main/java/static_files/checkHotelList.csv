"Panorama Guest House","Hanuman Ghat Out Side Chand Pole, Udaipur","Udaipur","3.4","Free Wifi*Free Parking*Air Conditioning","Very friendly staff who always said hello and food in the rooftop restaurant with views of the lakes always exceeded our expectations, very cheap and tasty. We paid £50 for 5 nights and 4 breakfasts. However.. we noticed a number of mosquitoes around the room and hotel but that’s to be expected when staying in a lakeside hotel. There were also small black bugs on the bed which were jumping around, this meant that we had to set our mosquito nets and sleeping bag liners out on the bed to prevent any unwanted guests. ","The roof top resturant offers a great view and you can spend lot of time sitting there. The hotel is very clean and room service was a bit slow but it was good. Good architecture. Location of this place is really nice.
