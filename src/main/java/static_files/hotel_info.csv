Pool","Set back away from the hustle and bustle was this lovely hotel set amidst beautiful well kept gardens. On two sides of the small road both with pools, we were on the Tabla restaurant side which we preferred as was more secluded and with less rooms. Nice walk into the town or a taxi ride any further which would cost just over £2. Hotel bus would drop you to one end of the beach but we mainly used the taxis outside, there was always a couple parked up waiting, to drop us to the middle of Baga beach drop off on CSM Road to the Big Banana beach shack we would go. Good food in the restaurant and very friendly staff all round we will definitely be back next year",Stayed here few days during Goa visit. Pros.. Location of the resort s near to Happening beaches. Still it's bit inside the street so its away from Traffic and Noice. Check in was okay.. Rooms were spacious. ,Premier Suite,3,"6,000"
